## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Had trouble saving the data between screens. 
Also had trouble getting the number to update with the slider info.
Switching between doubles and ints in calculations. 
Slider would spit out doubles soo had to cast it to an int, to drop the decimal.
